# optimal_patch
I constract an optimal patch that transform a source file to a target file. The term optimal here means that the patch generated by my algorithm contains the smallest operations that transform a file to another.
for example if we wont to transform this source file to this target file:

S1                       S1
S2                       T1
S3                       T2

source file             target source

we have different way we can do :
+ 1 T1
+ 1 T2
- 2 S2
- 3 S3
or
= 1 T1
= 1 T2
as we see, each of this two patch have different cost.
let us present the cost of each instruction in the patch befor begin:


the algorithm is based on the dynamic programmation. I modelisate the file
